**listings_test** 

The listings_test demonstrates my ability to use phpunit to test an existing project, and to add new features based on the written tests (Test Driven Development). 

Note: 

Teamtreehouse.com PHP Techdegree exceeding grade changes: Code coverage 100% for ListingFeatured, ListingPremium and ListingBasic classes. 

## How to setup on local machine

git clone https://github.com/allan9595/listings_test.git

Place the repo in a web server of your choice (XAMPP for Windows, MAMP for Mac)

Install PHP(version must be match with the web server's php version), composer, and xdebug(on your webserver) if you haven't. You can refer to [https://xdebug.org/docs/install](https://xdebug.org/docs/install) and [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/) for the process.

Open a terminal under the folder and type in "composer install" 

Then "composer update"
